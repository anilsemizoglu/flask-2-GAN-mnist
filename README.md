# flask-2-GAN-mnist
Create a handwritten digit using a GAN trained generator. 

See my repo on the code on how I trained the GAN. https://github.com/anilsemizoglu/deep-GAN-mnist

Generated digits are validated through a separate model until a certain confidence level is reached.

## To do
1. Add user interaction to let them select the (1)digit to be generated, (2)confidence level, (3)number of tries allowed

2. Deploy on AWS 

3. Build a pretty front-end
